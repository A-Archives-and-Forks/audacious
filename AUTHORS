HISTORY

Audacious was originally based on the X Multimedia System ("XMMS") via its GTK+
2.x port Beep Media Player ("BMP").  Since its first release, Audacious has
changed quite a bit, and little of the XMMS/BMP codebase remains.

The Audacious project began in 2005 under the leadership of William Pitcock
("nenolod").  Many people have made contributions, both large and small, since
that time.  Currently the project is led by John Lindgren and Michał Lipski
("tallica"), with help from a few others.  Special thanks go to Michał Lipski
for setting up and maintaining the current website.

The Audacious logo was designed by George Averill and updated by John Lindgren.
It uses the "Circulate" font created by Brian Kent.

Besides the developers listed below, a word of thanks is also due to the many
people who have helped to translate the Audacious interface into a number of
different (human) languages.  The translation effort is now done mostly through
Transifex, making it easier to contribute but also nearly impossible to
maintain a list of those who have done so.
