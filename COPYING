DETAILS AND EXCEPTIONS

Other than the Audacious logo itself, the images included with Audacious are
based on the Tango Icon Library and are in the public domain.

We want to relicense Audacious under a simpler 2-clause BSD-style license.  To
this end, many source files are marked with such a license.  As a whole,
however, Audacious is still licensed under the GNU GPL, version 3.  The future
license is as follows:

    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

    1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
       this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.

    2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
       this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in the
       documentation provided with the distribution.

    This software is provided “as is” and without any warranty, express or
    implied.  In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising
    from the use of this software.

The command-line client (“audtool”) is licensed under a 3-clause BSD-style
license, as follows:

    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

    1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
       this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.

    2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
       notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in the
       documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

    3. The name of the author may not be used to endorse or promote products
       derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

    This software is provided by the author “as is,” and any express or implied
    warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed.  In no
    event shall the author be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
    special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to,
    procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits;
    or business interruption), however caused and on any theory of liability,
    whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or
    otherwise), arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if
    advised of the possibility of such damage.
