DETAILS AND EXCEPTIONS

Other than the Audacious logo itself, the images included with Audacious are
based on the Tango Icon Library and are in the public domain.

We want to relicense Audacious under a simpler 2-clause BSD-style license.  To
this end, many source files are marked with such a license.  As a whole,
however, Audacious is still licensed under the GNU GPL, version 3.  The future
license is as follows:

    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

    1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
       this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.

    2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
       this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in the
       documentation provided with the distribution.

    This software is provided “as is” and without any warranty, express or
    implied.  In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising
    from the use of this software.
