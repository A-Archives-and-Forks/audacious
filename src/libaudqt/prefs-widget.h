 * basic idea is this.  create classes which wrap the PreferencesWidgets.
 * Each should have it's own get(), set() and widget() methods.  those are the
 * functions that we really care about.
 * get() and set() allow for introspection and manipulation of the underlying
 * objects.  they also handle pinging the plugin which owns the PreferencesWidget,
 * i.e. calling PreferencesWidget::callback().
 * widget() builds the actual Qt side of the widget, hooks up the relevant signals
 * to slots, etc.  the result of widget() is not const as it is linked into a
 * layout manager or shown or whatever.
