What is libmpgdec?
==================

libmpgdec is a fully compliant ISO MPEG 1/2 Layer 1/2/3 decoder,
which shares no code with the `dist10' package. Instead, libmpgdec
is an extensively refactored version of the mpg123 sources included
with XMMS, which were released under the GPL.

Due to the fact that the mpg123 source in XMMS were incomplete, several
components have been recreated and enhanced, including the synthesis
algorithms.

Unlike it's predecessor, libmpgdec performs band-limited synthesis in order
to try to correct many of the shortcomings of the MPEG format. Also unlike
it's predecessor, useless assembly-based routines have been removed.

Additionally, libmpgdec 1.1 includes new psychoaccoustic modeling routines
to try to enhance listening experience.

libmpgdec 1.1 is the first "public" release, i.e. a release seperate from
Audacious with extra portability components added to improve adaptability
in other players and encoders/decoders. Versions of Audacious after 1.1
will use this library package instead of using a statically linked decoder.

How do I compile libmpgdec?
===========================

./configure
make
make install

libmpgdec makes use of Autotools, and requires Glib 2.x.

Why does an MP3 decoder library require Glib?
=============================================

Simple. Glib lets us conveniently do things we would be able to not as cleanly
do otherwise.

How do I program with libmpgdec?
================================

libmpgdec typically uses it's own thread for decoding. This is usually not a
major issue; however if it is, a lowlevel API (mainly undocumented) is provided
to allow for the implementation of custom event loops.
